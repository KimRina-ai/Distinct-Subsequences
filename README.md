# Distinct-Subsequences

Write a program that counts the number of occurrences of Z in X as a subsequence such that each has a distinct index sequence.


***INPUT***

-The first line of the input contains an integer N indicating the number of test cases to follow.

-The first line of each test case contains a string X, having length no greater than 10000.

-The second line contains another string Z having length no greater than 100.


***OUTPUT***

-For each test case, output the number of distinct occurrences of Z in X as a subsequence.

-Output for each input set must be on a separate line.
